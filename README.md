# OCEAN PULSE
### AI-Assisted Maritime Safety, Digital Ocean Twin & Fisher Fleet Coordination Platform
**Built for the SELF(E) College Hackathon 2026**

> *"See the risk. Prioritize the fleet. Protect lives."*

## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

Across India's coastal waters, over **35.74 Lakh active fishers** are enrolled under the Group Accident Insurance Scheme (GAIS). Premier scientific and defense agencies provide critical services: **INCOIS** produces advanced wave and storm overturning advisories up to 10 days ahead, **IMD** operates Doppler weather radars, and **ISRO** has deployed more than **20,000 Distress Alert Terminals (DATs)** for satellite-linked rescue.

However, a major operational gap remains between weather forecasting and timely life-saving interventions:

1. **Fragmented Signals:** Weather bulletins, satellite position fixes, ocean current maps, and VHF radio signals exist across separate systems.
2. **One Warning ≠ One Risk:** Two small fishing crafts caught in the outer band of the same gale storm experience drastically different danger depending on engine horsepower, hull profile, current heading, and radio range.
3. **Shore Attention is Limited:** Shore safety controllers cannot continuously scan hundreds of vessels simultaneously. They need an automated, **explainable prioritization layer** that highlights *who needs help first, why, and what action to take*.

**Ocean Pulse** solves this challenge with a unified platform comprising two connected user-facing interfaces:
- **Shore Safety Command Center:** An operational digital ocean twin with interactive geographic mapping, autonomous fleet urgency ranking, 15-minute projected hazard intersections, multi-operator incident dispatch, and evidence-grounded AI copilot briefings.
- **Fisherman HUD:** A mobile-first, touch-friendly cockpit for fishers aboard small vessels featuring press-and-hold emergency SOS (2-second confirmation to prevent accidental triggers), multilingual speech synthesis (English, Malayalam, Tamil, Hindi), safe heading vectors, and IndexedDB offline queueing.

```

### Key Differentiators:
1. **Deterministic, Authoritative Risk Engine (`ocean-pulse-rule-v1.0`):** Risk scores and fleet rankings are 100% rule-based and versioned. The system never relies on ungrounded AI percentages for navigation safety.
2. **Evidence-Grounded AI Copilot:** The AI copilot operates behind strict prompt constraints: it explains verified telemetry and radar evidence, but cannot fabricate sensor data, override mathematical scores, or declare a vessel safe without contact.
3. **Resilient Offline Queueing with Idempotency:** The Fisherman HUD caches unsent distress calls in local IndexedDB with UUID idempotency keys. Upon reconnection, messages reconcile automatically with zero duplicates.
4. **Honest Data Provenance:** The system explicitly marks simulated data and never claims physical connectivity to certified satellite beacons or real-world radar unless an active adapter is present.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Leaflet / HTML5 Canvas mapping, Web Speech API (speechSynthesis), `idb` (IndexedDB promise wrapper).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Socket.IO (authenticated real-time rooms), Prisma ORM, Zod runtime validation, Bcrypt password hashing, JWT authentication.
- **Database:** SQLite for zero-dependency local execution (`dev.db`); PostgreSQL for production deployments on Render.
- **Testing:** Vitest, Supertest (21 unit and integration tests covering risk calculations, tie-breakers, and idempotent SOS flows).

## 4. Quickstart & Local Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ (tested on Node v20 and v24)
- npm v9+

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone <repository-url> ocean-pulse
cd ocean-pulse
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example apps/api/.env
```
*(The default `.env` is pre-configured with SQLite for instant zero-config startup).*

### 3. Initialize & Seed Database
```bash
# Push Prisma schema to SQLite
npm run db:push

# Seed users, 10 Indian fishing vessels, and hazard zones
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Run the Test Suite
```bash
npm run test --workspace=apps/api
```
*(Runs all 21 unit and integration tests).*

### 5. Start Development Servers
```bash
# In terminal 1 (starts backend API & simulation on port 3001)
npm run dev:api

# In terminal 2 (starts web frontend on port 5173)
npm run dev:web
```
Open your browser at **`http://localhost:5173`** (or **`http://localhost:3001`** in production).

## 5. Evaluator Sample Accounts

Ocean Pulse includes 5 pre-seeded role accounts. A convenient **one-click role switcher** is built directly into the UI header and login page:

| Role | Email | Password | Intended Workflow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shore Operator** | `operator@oceanpulse.org` | `ShorePass123!` | Manages fleet triage, acknowledges distress alerts, dispatches logistics. |
| **Fisherman** | `fisher@oceanpulse.org` | `FisherPass123!` | Master of B01 Sagar Kanya; triggers SOS, tests multilingual audio HUD. |
| **Supervisor** | `supervisor@oceanpulse.org` | `SuperPass123!` | Coast Guard commander; authorizes external MRCC search-and-rescue escalations. |
| **Admin** | `admin@oceanpulse.org` | `AdminPass123!` | System configuration and security oversight. |
| **Demo Viewer** | `viewer@oceanpulse.org` | `DemoPass123!` | Read-only evaluation account for hackathon judges. |

---

## 6. Predefined Hackathon Scenarios

In the Shore Command toolbar, select any of the 5 repeatable scenarios:

1. **1. Approaching Storm Cell (Track Intersection):** Deep depression moves WSW at 18 km/h. Sagar Kanya (B01) is on a projected collision track reaching storm perimeter in ~12 min.
2. **2. Propulsion Breakdown & Reef Drift:** Samudra Ratna (B04) loses main engine propulsion; maneuvering speed drops by 50% and drift carries it toward rocky reefs.
3. **3. Communication Blackout & Stale Telemetry:** Kadal Rani (B03) enters a signal deadzone. Last contact age increments; status is marked *"CONTACT LOST — STATUS UNKNOWN"*.
4. **4. Multiple Concurrent SOS Alerts:** Matsya Jyoti (B02) reports flooding while Varuna (B07) reports a medical emergency; tests life-safety prioritization.
5. **5. Offline HUD Reconnection & Sync:** Fisherman HUD loses network, queues SOS locally in IndexedDB, and automatically reconciles without duplicates upon reconnection.

## 7. Render Production Deployment

Ocean Pulse ships as one Docker web service: the container builds the React frontend, runs the Express + Socket.IO API, applies the PostgreSQL Prisma schema, seeds the demo fleet, and serves both dashboards from the same public URL. The Dockerfile is suitable for Render, Railway, Northflank, and other Docker-based hosts.

### Option A: Render Blueprint (recommended)
1. Push the complete repository root to GitHub (the folder containing `Dockerfile`, `render.yaml`, and `package-lock.json`).
2. In Render, choose **New → Blueprint** and connect the repository.
3. Render reads `render.yaml` and provisions the Docker web service and PostgreSQL database.
4. Wait for the first deployment to finish. The container applies the PostgreSQL schema and seeds demo users before starting the web server.
5. Open the generated `onrender.com` URL. The shore console and fisherman HUD are served by the same application.

### Option B: Any Docker host (Railway / Northflank)
1. Create a new service from the GitHub repository and select **Dockerfile** deployment.
2. Set the Dockerfile path to `/Dockerfile` and build context to the repository root.
3. Add a PostgreSQL database and expose its connection string as `DATABASE_URL` to the web service.
4. Set `JWT_SECRET` to a unique random value (at least 32 characters) and set `DEMO_MODE=true`.
5. Configure the service to listen on the platform-provided `PORT` (the app defaults to `3001` locally).
6. Enable public HTTP networking. The container startup script applies the PostgreSQL schema, seeds demo data, and starts the app.

### Local development
- Copy `.env.example` to `apps/api/.env`.
- For local SQLite development, run `npm run db:push`, then `npm run db:seed`, then `npm run dev:api`.
- Build/deploy containers use the separate PostgreSQL schema automatically.

### Demo login accounts
The seed script creates these demonstration accounts. They are for the hackathon prototype only; do not reuse these passwords for real services:

| Role | Email | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Shore Operator | `operator@oceanpulse.org` | `ShorePass123!` |
| Fisherman | `fisher@oceanpulse.org` | `FisherPass123!` |
| Supervisor | `supervisor@oceanpulse.org` | `SuperPass123!` |
| Demo Viewer | `viewer@oceanpulse.org` | `DemoPass123!` |

**Prototype limitation:** vessel positions, weather conditions, hazards, and scenarios are simulated demo data unless a real provider integration is explicitly configured. Ocean Pulse is not a certified maritime distress system. In real emergencies, use certified equipment and official rescue channels.
